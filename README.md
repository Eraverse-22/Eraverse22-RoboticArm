# 🤖 Dummy Robotic Arm – Eraverse-22

This project is a university robotic arm developed as part of Eraverse-22, using Arduino to control servos based on FSM logic and Bluetooth input.

## 📋 Features

* 2-link robotic arm (20 cm + 10 cm)
* FSM-based control system
* Bluetooth module for wireless control
* Servo torque management
* Basic pick-and-place logic

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Arduino Uno
* Servo Motors (13.1 kg-cm)
* Custom FSM logic
* Bluetooth module (HC-05 or similar)
* Breadboard and external PSU

## 🚀 How It Works

* Controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth commands
* Switches FSM states based on received signals
* Uses torque balancing and gripper logic
* Executes movement sequences according to user input

## 🧠 Built by

This project was developed by a university team as part of a collaborative effort. My role focused on electrical system design, control logic, and servo integration.
